"""
Create and store fake sample image data.

The purpose of this project is to handle the creation and analysis of 
image data containing transient events (any event that lasts a limited 
period of time in the search space).

The makedata package provides the tools to create sample data on your 
own. In this context, image data is an n by m array of 1-Dimensional
intensity data. We will be using numpy arrays for this purpose.
The data itself will be stored. Never written a docstring before,
so I probably screwed something up.

Exports:
The generate module.
