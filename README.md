# CCBias
CCBias is a tool designed to help researchers understand how observation selection bias in event detection influences their data and conclusions. CCbias is designed with Astronomy in mind, but the core functionality is model agnostic, meaning it could be as easily applied to events associated with animals as events associated with Astronomy.

I wrote CCBias for my undergraduate thesis, so as the deadline loomed, documentation was sacrificed for other things. This ought to be fixed soonâ„¢.
