# CCBias
CCBias is a tool designed to help researchers understand how observation selection bias in event detection influences their data and conclusions. CCbias is designed with Astronomy in mind, but the core functionality is model agnostic, meaning it could be as easily applied to events associated with animals as events associated with Astronomy.
